## 💡 Inspiration

TripBuddy was born out of the frustration of:
- Losing your itinerary 10 minutes after writing it down 📝.
- Packing for a beach vacation and forgetting your swimsuit 🩳.
- Struggling to split expenses fairly among travel buddies (yes, we see you, Karen 👀).

We thought, *"There has to be a better way."* And thus, TripBuddy came to life.
