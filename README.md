## 💡 Inspiration

**travelBuddy** was created out of the frustration of:
- Losing your itinerary ten minutes after writing it down 📝.
- Packing for a beach vacation and forgetting the swimsuit 🩳.
- Struggling to split expenses fairly with travel companions (yes, we see you, Karen 👀).

We thought, *"There’s got to be a better way!"* And thus, **travelBuddy** was born.
